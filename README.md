# Minimax Connect 4

Play connect 4 against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm. This project was created so I could better understand how the minimax algorithm works. The minimax algorithm used is very similar to the one used in my tic tac toe one: https://github.com/TrackerJo/Minimax-Tic-Tac-Toe, but I had to optimize the algorithm a little more so the AI would be a little faster.



## Getting Started
You can play for yourself by downloading this project here: https://github.com/TrackerJo/minimax-tic-tac-toe/releases/tag/ai or play it online here: https://replit.com/@nkemme54/Minimax-Tic-Tac-Toe
